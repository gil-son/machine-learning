<details> <summary> <h2><img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/6062/6062189.png" width="80"/> What is Machine Learning?</h2></summary>

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to learn from experience (data) and improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed with rules.
Instead of following hardcoded instructions, the system identifies patterns in data and uses those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

<h3>Analogy:</h3>
Think of a baby learning to recognize animals. At first, the baby is shown pictures of cats and dogs. Over time, the baby begins to notice patterns — cats have pointy ears, dogs often have longer snouts. Eventually, the baby can identify a new picture as a "dog" or "cat" based on what they’ve seen before — even without being told the rules. Machine Learning works in a similar way: it learns from examples instead of being told exactly what to do.

<h3>Example:</h3>
A machine learning model learns to recommend movies based on a user's viewing history and preferences — just like how a friend might suggest a movie based on what you’ve enjoyed before.

<h3><img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/6229/6229938.png" width="70"/> Supervised Learning </h3>
This is by far the most widely used type of ML in real-world applications.

- **Use Cases:**
  - Email spam detection
  - Credit scoring
  - Medical diagnosis
  - House price prediction

<h4> ✅ Popular Algorithms </h4>

<details>
  <summary><img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2620/2620536.png" width="50"/> Linear Regression</summary>

- **Concept:** Predicts a continuous value (e.g., student test score) based on one or more input features.
- **Essential Math:**
  
    # $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \cdots + w_nx_n + b$


- It minimizes the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between predicted and actual values.
- **Use Case:** Predicting prices, trends, or scores.

- **Concept:** Used for binary classification (e.g., pass/fail, spam/ham).
- **Essential Math:**

  # $P(y = 1 \mid x) = \sigma(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \cdots + w_nx_n + b)$

  Where the **sigmoid function** is:

  # $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$

<details>
  <summary><img src="https://i.ibb.co/4R3pTJyj/svm.png" width="50"/>  Support Vector Machines (SVM)</summary>

- **Concept:**
  - Finds the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.
- **Essential Math:**
  - Decision boundary:
    # $w \cdot x + b = 0$
  - Optimization constraint:
    # $y_i(w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1$
  - Margin to maximize:
    # $\frac{2}{\lVert w \rVert}$
- **Can use the _kernel trick_** (e.g., RBF kernel) to handle **non-linear** decision boundaries.  
- **Use Case:** Text classification, face recognition, bioinformatics.

- **Concept:** Classifies a sample based on the majority vote (classification) or average (regression) of its k closest neighbors.
- **Essential Math:**

  - **Euclidean Distance:**
    # $d(x, x') = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - x'_i)^2 }$

- **Other distance metrics** can be used, such as **Manhattan**, **Cosine**, or **Minkowski**, depending on the data.
- **Use Case:** Recommender systems, image classification, anomaly detection.
